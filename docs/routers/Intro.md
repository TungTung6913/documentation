#Connext and Router Introduction

1. Who are router?
- It is undeniable that Router is one of the crucial part that make a lot of Cross-Chain protocols moving since simply, it is the one who bring liquidity
and help to transfer token or asset to another chain. 

2. Why Connext needs Router?
- With the concept of "Trustlessness", Connext implements Router to make no one rely on person or people. They do not need to trust anyone which might be 
the safe way to move the asset from one chain to another. Therefore, the main major reason is about "Truslessness" and its strong security"
- Also, Router helps provide liquidity on destination chain, in which overall, with the implment of Amarok Upgrade to Router, it can make no luquidity fragmentation
, no gas management, and lastly, no penalty for downtime.
- There are a lot of cases, and one of the clearest case is Ronin Bridge where the Bridge got hacked because of using node validator to sign 
the transaction, so in this case, people need to rely on Validator, but not with Connext and the Connext Router.

3. Security Assumption and Risk?
- Security Assumption : 

- Risk :
Sequencer downtime is occuring(will improve soon), fund can be delayed if the xApp is disconnected, and Comnpromised Router Private key


4. Business Model
- Provide Cross-Chain service to people who need or want to transfer and transport their assets from one chain to another and to help reduce the process of moving assets to 
another chain
